I use this blog to write about the software I'm creating and to document my processes. Hopefully, you'll find some bits interesting!

I'm a software engineer working on large live-service games. I've worked on games totalling over 6 billion play sessions and 20 million monthly players. In addition to gameplay programming, I maintain tools, systems, and libraries to increase the productivity of the other engineers around me.
